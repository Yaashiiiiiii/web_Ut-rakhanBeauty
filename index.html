        <h2 class="h-secondary center">HISTORY OF Uttarakhand</h2>
                <p class="center">Uttarakhand is a state in North India. Its name, which means "northern land" or "section" in Sanskrit, is mentioned in early Hindu texts as the combined region of Kedarkhand and Manaskhand.

                    In the Puranas, Uttarakhand was the ancient term for the central Indian Himalayas. Its peaks and valleys were known as Svarga loka: a temporary abode of the righteous, and the source of the Ganges. Indo-Aryan tribes arrived by the Vedic period. At that time, present-day Uttarakhand was also reportedly inhabited by rishis and sadhus. Uttarakhand is known as "the land of the gods" (Devbhumi) because of its number of Hindu pilgrimage sites. During the Vedic period, several small republics known as Janapada existed in this region. The Pauravas, Kushanas, Kunindas, Guptas, Katyuris, Palas, Chands, Parmars (or Panwars), and the British have ruled the state by turns.</p>
